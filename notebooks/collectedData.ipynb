      " Obesity is a common metabolic disorder caused by a sedentary lifestyle, and a high-fat and a high-glucose diet in the form of fast foods. High-fat diet-induced obesity is a major cause of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, whereas exercise and physical activity can ameliorate these disorders. Moreover, exercise and the gut microbiota are known to be interconnected, since exercise can increase the gut microbial diversity and contribute to the beneficial health effects. In this context, we analyzed the effect of diet and exercise on the gut microbiota of mice, by next-generation sequencing of the bacterial V4 region of 16S rRNA. Briefly, mice were divided into four groups: chow-diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat diet + exercise (HFX), and exercise-only (EX). The mice underwent treadmill exercise and diet intervention for 8 weeks, followed by the collection of their feces and DNA extraction for sequencing. The data were analyzed using the QIIME 2 bioinformatics platform and R software to assess their gut microbial composition, richness, and diversity. The Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio was found to be decreased manifold in the HFD and HFX groups compared to the CD and EX groups. The gut microbial richness was comparatively lower in the HFD and HFX groups and higher in the CD and EX groups (ACE, Chao1, and observed OTUs). However, the Shannon alpha diversity index was higher in the HFD and HFX groups than in the CD and EX groups. The beta diversity based on Jaccard, Bray–Curtis, and weighted UniFrac distance metrics was significant among the groups, as measured by PERMANOVA. Paraprevotella, Desulfovibrio, and Lactococcus were the differentially abundant/present genera based on the intervention groups and in addition to these three bacteria, Butyricimonas and Desulfovibrio C21c20 were differentially abundant/present based on diet. Hence, diet significantly contributed to the majority of the changes in the gut microbiota.\n"

      "The obesity pandemic has been the largest contributor to ill health according to the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the latest WHO fact sheets, more than 1.9 billion adults and 600 million individuals have been classified as overweight or obese worldwide, respectively, and these rates are projected to increase at a faster pace in the coming decades. Obesity is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors including genetic predisposition, the disruption of energy metabolism, and environmental and social factors. A high-fat diet (HFD) and inadequate physical activity are major environmental factors causing obesity, while genetics also plays an important role in terms of body weight homeostasis. Obesity is, therefore, expected to place a serious burden on the public healthcare system. Coronary artery disease risk factors and obesity are positively correlated. Obesity causes several changes in the body, including the induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Specifically, morbid obesity is associated with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and venous thromboembolism.\n",
      "Microorganisms are present on and in the human body, thriving on the skin and in the genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts, and constitutes our microbiota, which is dominated by 2000 anaerobic bacteria. Host nutrition, metabolic function, and maturation of the immune system are greatly benefited by healthy microbiota. A more comprehensive analysis of the gut microbiota has been enabled by the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Recently, a National Institute of Health (NIH), USA, project revealed the presence of more than 70 bacterial phyla in the gut microbiota, with the majority belonging to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Another study revealed that obesity was associated with changes in the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota in diet-induced obese and knockout mice. Studies have shown that there are diverse numbers of microbial species in the distal gastrointestinal tract, and the balance between the composition and function of these intestinal microbes is disturbed during gut dysbiosis.\n",
      "The host physiology is heavily dependent on the gut microbiota, and the host metabolism may be affected by differences in gut microbial composition. Population and clinical studies have identified various factors that cause changes in the human microbiome, illustrating that microbiota are closely associated with disease and health. For instance, the childbirth delivery method, use of antibiotics, physical activity, and diet can regulate the gut microbial composition, where diet can explain over 50% of the changes in the gut microbiota. Diet has been indicated as a key determinant of gut microbiome composition, greatly influencing the selection of the gut microbiota.\n",
      "Moreover, endurance exercise can also benefit human health by the diversification of the gut microbiota. Numerous chronic diseases, including obesity, can be prevented or ameliorated by regular physical exercise. Exercise may help reduce inflammation, improve body composition, and nurture the gut microbial diversity that contributes to an efficient metabolism. Several controlled animal experiments have demonstrated that the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota can be altered by physical exercise alone. VO2 max, the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, is a measure of physical fitness and it was found to be correlated with the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (B/F) ratio. Although most studies have shown an increase in the B/F ratio following physical activity and exercise, some studies have instead reported a decrease in this ratio. Recent studies have shown that aerobic exercise results in a larger diversity and abundance of genera from the Firmicutes phylum, which could explain why exercise positively affects the gut and the brain. Elite rugby players showed a higher diversity of gut microbiota compared to other individuals, and the differences in the microbiota of these players were shown to be associated with decreased inflammation. Health-promoting bacteria were found to be increased in women performing the minimum amount of exercise regularly, as recommended by the WHO, and it had a positive effect on their body fat percentage and muscle mass. In a study evaluating the physical endurance of mice using swimming as an index of exercise capacity, the germ-free mouse model showed lower exercise capacity and decreased endurance when compared to the mice harboring a single bacterial species in their guts.\n",
      "There have been many studies on the factors that affect the microbiome, such as physical exercise and HFD. However, the effect of exercise in combination with diet intervention, such as HFD, on the composition of the gut microbiome, is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to understand the covariates responsible for the changes in the gut microbiota, using diet (involving chow and HFD) and treadmill exercise interventions, in the context of diet-induced obesity.\n",

      "The body weight and food intake of each mouse were recorded once a week for 8 weeks. Table 1 shows the average initial and final body weights of the mice at the end of the experiment. After the 8-week intervention, the HFD group showed a significant increase in the final body weight compared to the CD group (p < 0.0001). As expected, the HFD group mice showed a higher body weight than the mice in the EX group (p = 0.0003). Similarly, the HFX group mice gained significantly more weight than the CD group mice (p = 0.0046). However, the CD and EX groups showed similar weight gain after 8 weeks. HFD can induce weight gain and increase body fat content in mice, as reported previously. The mice in the HFX group weighed less on average compared to HFD-fed mice; however, no significant difference was recorded in weight gain between the HFD and HFX groups. The average food intake of the groups is shown in Table 1, with no significant differences observed among the groups.\n",
      "The gut microbial richness was determined using different alpha diversity indices. The HFX group had low richness as measured by ACE, Chao1 and observed OTUs, where no significant difference was observed compared to the HFD group. In contrast, the CD group showed the highest richness, with no significant difference compared to the EX group (Figure 2). Diversity estimation with the inverse Simpson metric showed patterns and results like those of the richness estimation analysis, with significantly lower diversity in the HFD and HFX groups than in the CD and EX groups (Figure 2). The Shannon diversity did not differ between the HFD and HFX groups, and between the CD and EX groups. Moreover, the Shannon index, which considers richness and evenness, was higher in the HFD and HFX groups than in the CD and EX groups. A similar pattern was observed for Pileou’s evenness (Figure 2).\n",
      "The structure of the gut microbial community of the different groups was examined using PCoA, and statistical significance was determined using PERMANOVA and confirmed using PERMDISP (Figure 3). There was a partial separation between the HFD and HFX groups along axis 1 and axis 2, in Bray–Curtis and weighted UniFrac distance-based PCoA. Jaccard, which is a qualitative non-phylogenetic beta diversity metric, showed significant differences among all groups (p ≤ 0.02), except for the HFD and HFX groups (Figure 3). Similarly, the Bray–Curtis metric was found to be significant among the groups (p ≤ 0.02, CD/EX, p = 0.024), except for the HFD and HFX groups. In contrast, the weighted UniFrac distance metric-based PCoA revealed significant differences among the groups (p < 0.02), except for CD/EX and HFD/HFX. Overall, the HFX and HFD groups showed higher variability, while the CD group had the lowest variability in Jaccard and Bray–Curtis based PCoA (Figure 3). Overall, the dissimilarities between the CD and EX groups were evident without overlap in Jaccard and Bray–Curtis-based PCoAs, and with some overlap in the weighted UniFrac-based PCoA.\n",
      "Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the two largest phyla in the gut, which together account for approximately 90% of the total gut microbiota. Bacteroidetes accounted for approximately 89% and about 83% of the OTUs in the CD and EX groups (p = 0.14, ns), respectively (Figure 4a). Likewise, the profile of Bacteroidetes in the HFD and HFX groups were similar but decreased to approximately half (p < 0.0001) of those estimated for the CD and EX groups. Moreover, Firmicutes accounted for about 24% and 16% of the OTUs in the HFD and HFX groups, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups (Figure 4a). In addition to the increased proportion of Firmicutes in the HFD and HFX groups, Proteobacteria also showed substantial expansion close to 40% in these groups (p < 0.0001) compared to the CD and EX groups (Figure 4a). Conversely, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the CD and EX groups was below 10%, and the profile was similar between the two groups. The relative abundance of the phylum Cyanobacteria significantly increased by approximately 4.7-fold, 7.8-fold, and ~30-fold in the EX group only, compared to the CD group (p = 0.04), HFX group (p = 0.02), and HFD group (p = 0.009), respectively. Nonetheless, the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was rare in the intervention groups (Figure 4a).\n",
      "Paraprevotellaceae was the most abundant bacterial family of the phylum Bacteroidetes in the CD group and was significantly prevalent compared to its negligible proportions in the HFD and HFX groups (p < 0.0001) (Figure 4b). The EX group showed a significant decrease in the Paraprevotellaceae family compared to the CD group (p = 0.01). Another family of Bacteroidetes, S24-7, was significantly higher in relative abundance in the high-fat diet-fed groups (HFD and HFX) in comparison to the chow-fed groups (CD and EX) (p < 0.0001), regardless of the effect of exercise activity (Figure 4b). Likewise, Desulfovibrionaceae of the phylum Proteobacteria showed a similar pattern of relative abundance, with an increased proportion of about 20–30% in the HFD and HFX groups compared to about 2–4% in the CD and EX groups (p < 0.0001). Streptococcaceae, which belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, was rarely identified in the CD group, but was significantly abundant in the HFD group (~16%) (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the abundance of the Streptococcaceae family was significantly reduced in the HFX group ~1.6-fold compared to the HFD group (p = 0.01) (Figure 4b). The bacterial taxonomic families responsible for the increased abundance of the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in the high-fat diet-fed groups (HFD, HFX) were Desulfovibrionaceae and Streptococcaceae, respectively (Figure 4). In contrast, the reduction of Paraprevotellaceae in the high-fat diet-fed groups (Figure 4b) might be the major contributing taxonomic family for the decreased proportion of phylum Bacteroidetes observed in these groups (Figure 4a).\n",
      "Among the 30 taxa identified at the genus or species level in the mouse gut (Figure 5a), Paraprevotella, Desulfovibrio, and Lactococcus were significantly altered in the experimental groups, as illustrated in Figure 5b. Paraprevotella of the phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in relative abundance in the EX group (p = 0.0006) compared to the CD group. However, its abundance was scarce in the HFD and HFX groups, with no difference between the groups. The decreased percentage of Bacteroidetes in the HFD and HFX groups compared to that in the CD and EX groups can be attributed to the decreased abundance of Paraprevotella (Figure 4a and Figure 5a,b). The genus Desulfovibrio from the Proteobacteria phylum increased significantly in the HFD and HFX groups compared to its proportion in the CD and EX groups (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the proportion of the Desulfovibrio genus was significantly higher in the HFX group than in the HFD group (p = 0.017). The relative increase in the proportion of Firmicutes in the HFD and HFX groups (Figure 4a) was reflected at the genus level and is attributed to Lactococcus. Lactococcus was significantly reduced in the HFX group ~1.6-fold compared to its proportion in the HFD group (p < 0.0009), as shown in Figure 5a, b. The presence of Lactococcus was not identified in the CD and EX groups. Moreover, Bacteroides ovatus, Sutterella, Atherosperma moschatum, Anaeroplasma, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Coprobacillus were identified with negligible relative abundance in all the experimental groups (data not shown). Unidentified species fell in the range of ~20–50% (Figure 5a).\n",
      "ANCOM based on diet revealed the differentially abundant or present taxa in the high-fat diet-fed groups and chow-fed groups. Among these, Paraprevotella (Paraprevotellaceae, Bacteroidetes) and Desulfovibrio C21c20 (Desulfovibrionaceae, Proteobacteria) were differentially abundant/present in the chow-fed groups (CD, EX), whereas Lactococcus (Streptococcaceae, Firmicutes), Desulfovibrio (Desulfovibrionaceae, Proteobacteria) and Butyricimonas (Odoribacteraceae, Bacteroidetes) were differentially abundant/present in the high-fat diet-fed groups (HFD, HFX) (Figure 5c). Almost half of the microbiota that were significantly altered with respect to the diet intervention belonged to S24-7 bacterial taxonomic family of the order Bacteroidales, within the phylum Bacteroidetes. Moreover, 80% of S24-7 family members identified by ANCOM based on diet were relatively significantly abundant in the high-fat diet-fed groups (Figure 5c).\n",
      "The most important taxa within the OTU table were generated using the random forest machine-learning algorithm (Figure 6). The majority of the members of the order YS2 from the phylum Cyanobacteria were relatively abundant in the EX group compared to the other groups. On the other hand, Allobaculum (Firmicutes) was relatively abundant in the CD group, as shown in the heatmap (Figure 6). Among the four Adlercreutzia (Actinobacteria) species identified as the important taxa between the intervention groups, three were relatively abundant in the high-fat diet-fed groups (HFD, HFX) (Figure 6). Oscillospira (Firmicutes) was insignificantly enhanced in the HFX group compared to the other groups. Two species of Odoribacter (Bacteroidetes) were identified with contrasting abundance profiles, where one taxon showed moderately higher abundance in HFD than the other groups, while the other taxon showed strikingly higher abundance in all groups except HFD (Figure 6). Coprococcus (Firmicutes) was found to be relatively mildly higher in abundance in the high-fat diet-fed groups. Desulfovibrio and Lactococcus were abundant in the HFD and HFX groups, while Prevotella was relatively frequently observed in the CD and EX groups (Figure 6).\n",

      "Four-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (n = 5) were randomly assigned to four groups, namely chow diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat diet + exercise (HFX), and exercise-only (EX) groups. Normal mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet (protein 18%, fat 5%, fiber 5%, ash 5% of total weight) and HFD mice were fed a high-fat diet (protein 20.5%, fat 34.9%, fiber, ash 8.0%, calcium, phosphorus 0.5% of total weight). The mice were housed in sterile cages, at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 50 ± 10%, under 12 h light/dark cycle. After 8 weeks of diet and treadmill exercise intervention, the mice were fasted for 12 h and sacrificed by isoflurane overdose in a random order. The body weight of the mice was recorded every week until the last week. Fecal samples from individual mice were collected by restraint, in sterile microcentrifuge tubes, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C, until further processing. The design of the study is presented in Figure 1.\n",
      "The mice were housed in a cage for a week and adapted to treadmill exercise for five days prior to the start of the exercise experiment. Exercise was performed for 8 weeks in a treadmill chamber. Mice from the EX and HFX groups underwent treadmill exercise for a duration of 60 min/day on a 5% slope, with a gradually increasing intensity from 4 m/min to 15 m/min for the initial 30 min, then increasing to 20 m/min for another 30 min, followed by 5 min of cooling at 5 m/min.\n",
      "The mouse fecal samples (frozen) were thawed at 4 °C and weighed (200 mg) for DNA extraction by SPINeasy DNA Kit for Feces (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the stool samples were homogenized using a Fast-Prep 24 (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA) bead homogenizer in tubes prefilled with high-quality beads, which ensured the disruption of the cell walls and the release of DNA into the solution. The extracted DNA was examined for integrity using electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and visualized using ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n",
      "DNA quantification and quality measurements were performed using two spectrophotometric devices, Spectra Max iD3 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Qubit 4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), based on the absorbance and fluorescence readouts, respectively. The A260/A280 absorbance ratio determined using Spectra Max iD3 was used to estimate the quality and purity of the extracted DNA, while the concentration was measured using Qubit 4.\n",
      "The extracted DNA was amplified using barcoded primers that targeted the bacterial V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We used V4 region-specific primers along with locus-specific overhang sequences for PCR. The sequences used were 515F-5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA- 3′ and 806R -5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGACTACHVGGGTWTCT- AAT-3′. The PCR thermal cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. We attached the indices and Illumina sequencing adapters through index-PCR using the Nextera XT index kit v2 (Illumina, USA). The PCR thermal cycling conditions for index-PCR were 95 °C for 3 min, 72 °C for 5 min, eight cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR clean-up was performed to purify the 16S V4 amplicons using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), after every PCR amplification. The samples were normalized, pooled, mixed with the PhiX control v3 (Illumina), and sequenced using the Illumina iSeq 100 platform.\n",
      "Paired-end FASTQ sequences were imported into QIIME2 v2021.04 and inspected with FastQC for quality control parameters, such as PhiX contamination, read trimming, and adapter sequences. The analysis was carried out using QIIME 2, unless otherwise stated. The PCR primers were removed using Cutadapt v3.4 and the sequences were merged using VSEARCH v2.7.0, followed by quality filtration (Q20) and dereplication. De-novo clustering was performed to select OTUs, followed by chimera removal, and representative sequences and abundances were extracted. A naïve Bayes classifier was trained using 16S rRNA V4 region sequences extracted from the Greengenes 13.8 database, and the representative sequences were classified by taxon using the trained classifier. Alpha diversity indices, such as observed OTUs, Chao1, ACE, and Inverse Simpson, were estimated using the phyloseq package v1.38 of R, by importing the data from QIIME 2 in biom format. However, Shannon and Pileou’s evenness were estimated using QIIME 2. Alpha diversity significance was calculated using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by the improved Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed based on Jaccard, Bray–Curtis, and weighted UniFrac distance metrics to stratify the samples and determine the microbial community structure. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was employed to determine the statistical significance of the PCoA results, which were later confirmed by PERMDISP. Longitudinal ANOVA and ADONIS were used to determine the significant covariates of diversity. Analysis of the composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) was employed to determine differentially abundant taxa. The random forest model was used to generate a heatmap of important taxa. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey’s post hoc test. The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.\n",

       "     'text': 'According to a 2017 global epidemiological survey, the worldwide prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is about 9.1%. Death caused by CKD or impaired renal function accounted for 4.6% of all deaths in 2017, and CKD was the twelfth leading cause of death. The immense public health burden of CKD has aroused great interest in research into the mechanism and potential therapy of this disease worldwide. In clinical settings, kidney ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury leaded acute kidney injury is a common complication of major surgery such as cardiac surgery (accounting for 20%) and abdominal surgery. Furthermore, it is also a common reason for delayed graft function after kidney transplantation. I/R injury eventually results in serious adverse outcome of progressing to CKD. Renal fibrosis with deposition of collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins is the basic feature of CKD. Targeting cytokines, transcription factors, developmental, and signaling pathways has been shown to ameliorate kidney fibrosis in preclinical studies. In addition, experts in various fields have collaborated to provide insights into novel strategies to prevent and treat CKD through animals and biomimetic studies. In the current post-genomic era, the application of systems biology enables in-depth analysis of CKD at the molecular and subcellular level. It is imperative to explore promising effective therapeutic strategies for CKD.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Licorice is the most widely used herbal medicine in the world, and is grown in China, Japan, and Russia. 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is the most well-known active metabolite of licorice, which has multiple functions; it not only has detoxification properties, but also possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and liver-protective functions. Previous studies have reported that GA plays a role in kidney disease. The study by Abd El-Twab et\\xa0al. showed that GA reduced methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity by upregulating the mRNA of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hemoxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the kidney, which is related to attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation. Ma et\\xa0al. established a cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model and demonstrated that GA inhibited renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis by targeting histone deacetylases 2 (HDAC2) and enhancing the level of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) epigenetically. Furthermore, GA is also a very promising anti-fibrotic treatment for patients with chronic liver disease. Wang et\\xa0al. demonstrated that GA downregulated the mRNA expression of type I and III pre-collagen and reduced the deposition of collagen in fibrotic rat liver. However, no study has investigated the role of GA in ameliorating kidney fibrosis in\\xa0vivo. Hence, the present study aimed to uncover the potential protective effect of GA in kidney fibrosis and explore its underlying mechanisms.',\n",

Secondly, using single kidney creatinine rather than systemic SCr was more accurate to monitor renal function for this model. We might say the normal or mild higher creatinine of the contralateral right kidney was temporary. The function of it gradually deteriorated due to the infiltration of a large amount of inflammatory cells.

       "     'text': 'In this study, a number of downregulated DEGs were enriched in the T cell activation process, thereby suggesting that GA treatment may be related to decreased adaptive immune response in I/R-induced renal fibrosis. T lymphocyte, an important immune cell, participates in various organ injuries. In fact, activated T cells accumulated in the kidney within just a few hours when ischemic acute renal failure occurred. Classically, complete activation of T cell requires at least two signals. Signal 1 is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in antigen presenting cells (APC) that process antigens and present it to T cell via combination with T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex. At the same time, B7 and CD28, on the surface of APC and T cell, respectively, recognize each other as the costimulatory signal. Genes, correlated with T cell activation, were downregulated in BP analysis, such as Icos, Cd3g, Cd3d, Cd80, Cd8, Cd3g; Cd3d encodes γ and δ peptide chains, which make up protein CD3 on T cell. Decreases of the two peptide chains directly influence the assembly of the TCR–CD3 complex, resulting in reduced T cell activation. In addition, Cd80 and Cd86 encode CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) of APC, respectively, which are the crucial components of the costimulatory signal in mice. Their downregulation also blocks T cell activation. ICOS is inducible and is expressed in activated T cell, but not on naïve T cell. Low expression of the gene Icos proved that T cell activation was reduced after GA treatment. Lower activation of T cell protects against renal fibrosis. T cells are mainly divided into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of note, CD4+ (but not CD8+) T cell function seems more explicit and more important in promoting renal fibrosis. Liu et\\xa0al. found that depleting CD4+ T cell with anti-CD4 antibody inhibited renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model. Furthermore, adaptive transfer of CD4+ type 2\\u2009T helper cell (Th2) induced more severe renal fibrosis than Th1 cell, identifying CD4+ Th2 cell as a potential target in renal fibrosis.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Myeloid leukocyte migration is another important differential enrichment biologic process; specifically, the mononuclear phagocyte system has a crucial role in renal inflammation and fibrosis. Monocytes, almost entirely derived from the bone marrow, in response to inflammatory factors, are recruited in the injured kidney by chemokines. Then, monocytes transform into macrophages in the tissue. A number of chemokines contribute to macrophage recruitment and accumulation, such as CCL2, CX3CL1, CCL5, and CXCL16. CCL2, namely C-C motif chemokine 2, is known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Alsheikh et\\xa0al. demonstrated that CCL2/CCR2 was important in the early recruitment of leukocytes in rat hypertension kidney damage model. In a clinical setting, Puthumana et\\xa0al. found higher CCL2 level was associated with greater eGFR decline. Studies have also reported that blocking CCL2 or its receptor CCR2 had a protective effect on kidney. Pharmacological blockade of CCL2 or CCR2 have successfully entered clinical trials studying treatment of type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. CX3CL1 is the only member of the CX3C superfamily, whose transmembrane region undergoes proteolytic cleavage to generate a soluble form as chemokine. The study by Peng et\\xa0al. revealed that CX3CR1, the receptor of CX3CL1, expressed in monocytes was required for macrophage accumulation in the kidney and promoted renal fibrosis in UUO model. Similarly, other chemokines also play roles in macrophage recruitment. Coincidentally, some genes that encode chemokines are listed in our analysis of hub genes, thereby suggesting that recruitment of immune cells to the injured focus is important for I/R-induced fibrosis and GA has the ability to reduce chemokines, and in turn, decrease the accumulation of inflammatory cells.',\n",

       "     'text': 'Macrophages have high plasticity. In in\\xa0vitro studies, macrophages can be induced into M1 or classically activated phenotype (proinflammatory) by interferon (IFN)-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or into M2 or alternatively activated phenotype (anti-inflammatory) by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. Apart from recruitment in\\xa0vivo, there are resident macrophages in the kidney. All the recruited and resident macrophages polarize to M1 or M2 subtypes according to the local microenvironment. In the I/R animal model, the infiltrated macrophage is predominantly of M1 phenotype in the early inflammatory phase, while M2 phenotype becomes predominant in the repair phase. In impaired repair, M2 macrophage is strongly associated with renal fibrosis. Sasaki et\\xa0al. found that deleting Irf4, which is a mediator of macrophage polarization to M2 subtype, could reduce renal fibrosis 4\\u2009weeks after acute kidney injury through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Another study indicated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates macrophage activation and transformed them to M2 phenotype with resultant kidney fibrosis. Macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) is a well-known theory. Myofibroblast is the pivotal cell in fibrosis, contributing to collagen production and deposition. In a clinical study, CD68\\u2009+\\u2009αSMA\\u2009+\\u2009co-expression cells were identified in active fibrotic lesions of patients’ samples, and most of these cells expressed CD206, thereby suggesting that macrophages which underwent MMT were of M2 subtype. Similar results have also been found in animal studies. In addition, macrophages secrete some pro-fibrotic factors, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and platelet-derived growth factor. The downregulated hub gene Pf4 in our analysis, encoding platelet factor 4 (PF4), is an upstream factor of MMP-mediated fibrosis. The study by Yang et\\xa0al. found neutralization of PF4 could target MMP-7 and suppress macrophages in 5/6 nephrectomized mice, preventing collagen destruction in the heart tissue. All the chemokines and factors downregulated by GA treatment contributed to reduced infiltration of myeloid leukocytes and alleviated fibrosis.',\n",

      " Abstract The vascular wall is comprised of distinct layers controlling angiogenesis, blood flow, vessel anchorage within organs, and cell and molecule transit between blood and tissues. Moreover, some blood vessels are home to essential stem-like cells, a classic example being the existence in the embryo of hemogenic endothelial cells at the origin of definitive hematopoiesis. In recent years, microvascular pericytes and adventitial perivascular cells were observed to include multi-lineage progenitor cells involved not only in organ turnover and regeneration but also in pathologic remodeling, including fibrosis and atherosclerosis. These perivascular mesodermal elements were identified as native forerunners of mesenchymal stem cells. We have presented in this brief review our current knowledge on vessel wall-associated tissue remodeling cells with respect to discriminating phenotypes, functional diversity in health and disease, and potential therapeutic interest. Graphical Abstract Contribution of blood vessel walls to non-vascular tissue development and regeneration. (A) In the embryo, definitive, adult-type hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (green spheres) are produced by a subset of blood-forming endothelial cells that operate transiently in the ventral aspect of the aorta (orange) and vitelline arteries. (B) In the developed organism, pericytes (red) detached from microvessels, and adventitial cells (dark grey) migrating from larger arteries and veins can be mobilized to sites of tissue injury and contribute to scarring (fibrosis) and regeneration.\n"

      " Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by renal fibrosis without effective therapy. 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is reported to have detoxification and anti-inflammatory functions and promotes tissue repair. However, the role of GA in CKD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether GA has a potential therapeutic effect in kidney fibrosis. A renal fibrosis mouse model was established by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury via clamping unilateral left renal pedicle for 45 min; then, the mice were treated with vehicle or GA. Kidney tissues and blood samples were extracted 14 days after reperfusion and renal function, histopathological staining, quantitative PCR, and western blotting were performed. RNA-seq was performed to explore the changes in the transcriptional profile after GA treatment. Renal function, pathological and molecular analysis displayed that fibrosis was successfully induced in the I/R model. In the GA treatment group, the severity of fibrosis gradually reduced with the best effect seen at a concentration of 25 mg kg −1. A total of 970 differentially expressed genes were identified. Pathway enrichment showed that reduced activation and migration of inflammatory cells and decreased chemokine interaction in significant pathways. Protein–protein interaction networks were constructed and 15 hub genes were selected by degree rank, including chemokines, such as C3, Ccl6, Ccr2, Ptafr, Timp1, and Pf4. GA may alleviate renal fibrosis by inhibiting the inflammatory response. GA is a promising therapy that may perhaps be used in treating renal fibrosis and CKD.\n"
